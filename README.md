      My interests and expertise expand from graphics-, motion- and sound design in dedicated software like Adobe Suite and Image-Line FL Studio up to programming in lots of different languages like <b>C#</b>, <b>Rust</b>, <b>Kotlin</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, <b>Objective-C</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>Python</b> and <b>Visual Basic</b>, with the first
      being my most and last being my least used languages. I mostly use my brief time productively, but if I don't, then I usually play chess, osu!, or Krunker.
      As a reason of peer pressure, I generally hang around on Discord but maintain daily activity on my email inbox and a couple of other forums.
